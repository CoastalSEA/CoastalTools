<h2>BODC Data Licence Agreement</h2>
<p>It is BODC's policy to encourage the use of our data holdings for science, education and industry, as well as the wider public. Data are made available under a licence agreement.
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>BODC grants the licensee a non-exclusive and non-transferable licence to retrieve and use data sets and products in accordance with this licence.
</li> 
<li>The use of unrestricted data sets for academic purposes is free of charge unless otherwise stipulated.
</li> 
<li>The use or reproduction of data for commercial purposes might require additional permission from the data source and may incur a charge.
</li> 
<li>The ownership of the data remains the property of NERC or the originating source providing the data to NERC.
</li> 
<li>Users should not give any data or products to third parties without prior consent from BODC.
</li> 
<li>Regardless of whether the data are quality controlled or not, BODC and the data source do not accept any liability for the correctness and/or appropriate interpretation of the data. Correct and appropriate data interpretation is solely the responsibility of data users.
</li> 
<li>Users must acknowledge data sources as it is not ethical to publish data without proper attribution. Any publication or other output resulting from usage of the data should include an acknowledgment.
<br />The recommended acknowledgment is:
<br /> 
<p>'This study uses data from 
<i>data source/organisation/programme
</i>, provided by the British Oceanographic Data Centre and funded by the 
<i>funding body
</i>.'
</p> 
</li> 
<li>BODC reserves the right to inform the data source of who has accessed what and when.
</li> 
<li>Users are requested to inform BODC (enquiries@bodc.ac.uk) of any problems encountered with data as this feedback may result in an enhancement in the quality of the data we hold.
</li> 
<li>BODC reserves the right to terminate this licence at any time if the above conditions are not observed.
</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>Optional co-authorship clause
</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Users must respect specified restrictions on the use or reproduction of data. In some circumstances, due acknowledgment is considered to be co-authorship on any publication or other output. This may be dependent on the usage of the data supplied, so should be the result of a negotiation between the data source and the data user.
</li> 
</ul>
